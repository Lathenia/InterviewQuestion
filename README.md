# About what this code do:
Let's say we have a two dimensional array with integers which is {{x,y}, {z,t}, {k,m}}. Let each one of the element be a row in a table. Such as,
First element is the first row, second element is the second row and so on.
This code checks each number's adjacents. For x, y and z are it's adjacents. For adjacents code will print 1 and for others it will print 0.
